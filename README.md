MiniGL-Mac
==========

Minimal OpenGL Mac OS X application 

Extracted from le2, for archival and reference purposes. 
This application does not use nib files and creates a menu with quit command at runtime. IIRC, we found this code in the Allegro lib ages ago, but I'm not sure anymore. 
Rendering happens in a seperate CVDisplayLink thread.
