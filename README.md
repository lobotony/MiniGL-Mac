MiniGL-Mac
==========

Minimal OpenGL Mac OS X application 

* This application does not use nib files and creates a menu with quit command at runtime. IIRC, we found this code in the Allegro lib ages ago, but I'm not sure anymore. 
* Rendering happens in a seperate CVDisplayLink thread. 
* Extracted from [le2](https://github.com/lobotony/le2), for archival and reference purposes.
